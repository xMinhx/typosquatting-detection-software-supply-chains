## Abstract

In recent years, typosquatting has become a significant threat
to software supply chain systems, where malicious packages deceptively
mimic legitimate ones. Attackers register these fraudulent packages with
names strikingly similar to those of legitimate packages. As a result, de-
velopers can mistakenly download these malicious packages by mistyping
the intended package name or selecting a package based on its convincing
yet deceptive name.
In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of string-matching algorithms
in identifying potential typosquatting candidates. We construct an open
dataset comprising 394 typosquatting packages and evaluate the perfor-
mance of these algorithms based on their ability to detect typosquatting
packages. In addition, we introduce a novel string-matching algorithm,
an extension of the Damerau-Levenshtein distance, demonstrating a no-
tably higher true-positive rate than existing methods. Since our dataset
contains features not previously considered, we also investigate how these
new features affect the assignment accuracy of ML-based classifiers. Our
results show an overall accuracy rate of 98.4% on our datasets and 96.0%
and 93.5% accuracy on evaluating two other open datasets. These results
provide valuable insights for researchers, package manager vendors, and
developers to improve their understanding of malicious typosquatting
packages and improve mediation strategies and technologies.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Cloning the Repository**

   To clone the repository, use the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reponame.git
   ```
2. Use the `File Extraction.ipynb` Notebook to extract all packages
3. Use the `Feature Extraction.ipynb` Notebook to extract the defined features from all the packages
4. Execute the code cells in the `Machine Learning.ipynb` to execute the model

## How was the dataset gathered?

The dataset consists of two types of information:
1. **Metadata** of the packages.
2. **Source code** of the packages.

We collected data from Sonatype, Phylum, and Snyk listings for typosquatting packages up until early 2023 has been added to the datasets. 
A package was included in the dataset if:
1. It was identified as a **typosquatting package**.
2. A **target package** for the typosquatting attack was provided.

### Preprocessing Steps
1. **Duplicate removal**: We checked for and removed duplicate entries.
2. **Error checking**: We identified and removed legitimate packages that were mistakenly listed (e.g., cases where a typo had been corrected).
3. **Existence check**: We verified whether the package has been or is existing. Even unpublished packages remained listed without metadata.
4. **Obfuscated package removal** We removed packages that deliberately make their code hard to read, beyond simple minification.

In the end 394 typosquatting package source code remained.

### Metadata Collection

The metadata was sourced directly from npm. In cases where npm replaced the package information with placeholders, we still accessed the available metadata. However, for packages that were **unpublished**, no metadata could be retrieved.

### Source Code Collection

The source code was gathered from npm mirrors, archived articles, or repositories.
